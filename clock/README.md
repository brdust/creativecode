# Abstract Artist Clocks

These are abstract clocks made with p5.js. The easiest way to see them in action is to copy the contents of the javascript file  into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it.

Each clock is designed to look like a piece of abstract art (a reflection of the fact that our understanding of time is abstract and entirely arbitrary to begin with), though slightly different at different parts of the day. Each clock is designed to be recognizable as itself no matter the time of day, and is named after artists it mimicks. 

# Stella Delaunay
[This clock](https://editor.p5js.org/brdust/present/54ShrZUqQ) is inspired by the artists Frank Stella, Robert Delaunay, and Sonia Delaunay. Designed entirely of translucent, concentric circles, the clock displays, like many of the hours in the series, the percentage of the hours passed in the day, the percentage of minutes passed in the current hour, and the percentage of seconds that have elapsed in that minute.

# Popova van Doesburg
[This clock](https://editor.p5js.org/brdust/full/pUMjqilLQ) is inspired by multiple artists, namely Lyubov Popova and Theo van Doesburg. This clock is one of the simplest, with the width of the dark blue triangle across the top of the display marking the progress through the hours of the day, and the green triangleâ€™s progress across the bottom marking the progress through the minutes of the current hour. The red circle that grows from the center is the most dynamic part of the clock, growing with each second until the minute is complete, at which point it disappears and starts from the center again. Each of these is partially transparent, creating a wider variety of colors as the minutes and hours interact with the seconds passing by.

# Malevich 
[This clock](https://editor.p5js.org/brdust/present/t5-TMDUA8) is designed to mimic the appearance of a painting in the style of Kazimir Malevich. The angle of the blue rectangle reflects the hours throughout the day, spinning in a circle around the canvas as the hours pass. The orange fleet of rectangles grows by one every five minutes, for a total of twelve rectangles towards the end of the hour, and resetting to one orange rectangle at the beginning of the next. The green triangle in the background grows one minute, and shrinks the next, alternating like so for all time.

# Mondrian
[This clock](https://editor.p5js.org/brdust/present/1ojId9mCZ) is designed in the style of the famous Piet Mondrian. The blue rectangles are the ones that display the passing time; the bottom left blue grows until it meets the next line to mark the hours, the top right blue grows until it meets the next line to mark the minutes of the hour, and the smallest blue rectangle disappears every five seconds, to reappear five seconds later, and so on.

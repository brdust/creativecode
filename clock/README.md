# Popova van Doesburg

This is an abstract clock I made with p5.js. The easiest way to see it in action is to copy the contents of [the javascript file](concentric-clock.js)  into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it.

The clock's time is displayed almost entirely in relative terms - as the 24 hours of the day pass, the blue triangle grows in size, the distance it stretches across the top of the display corresponding to the percent of hours in a day elapsed, and the same for the green triangle (the minutes in the current hour), as it extends across the bottom of the display. 

This clock is designed to look like a piece of abstract art (a reflection of the fact that our understanding of time is abstract and entirely arbitrary to begin with), though slightly different at different parts of the day. I've considered creating more clocks like this, basing each on a different way of measuring time, and making each its own abstract piece of art, maintaining enough of a consistant image to be recognizable and distinguishable from the other clocks, yet also able to 'tell' the time. This one, always displaying the green triangle of minutes, blue triangle of hours, and red circle(s) of seconds, will always look kind of the same, and be recognizable as this clock no matter the given time. 

The clock is named for two abstract artists (Lyubov Popova and Theo van Doesburg) who influenced some of my design choices.

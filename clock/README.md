# Abstract Artist Clocks

These are abstract clocks made with p5.js. The easiest way to see them in action is to copy the contents of [the javascript file](concentric-clock.js)  into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it.

Each clock is designed to look like a piece of abstract art (a reflection of the fact that our understanding of time is abstract and entirely arbitrary to begin with), though slightly different at different parts of the day. Each clock is designed to be recognizable as itself no matter the time of day, and is named after artists it mimicks. 

# Stella Delaunay
This clock is made of overlapping circles, one representing seconds, another representing minutes, and the last representing hours. It is designed to mimic the circular designs of both Robert and Sonia Delaunay, and the color choices of Frank Stella, whose style of art is also very similar to the Delaunays'. 

# Popova van Doesburg
This clock's time is displayed almost entirely in relative terms - as the 24 hours of the day pass, the blue triangle grows in size, the distance it stretches across the top of the display corresponding to the percent of hours in a day elapsed, and the same for the green triangle (the minutes in the current hour), as it extends across the bottom of the display. It is loosely inspired by the artists Lyubov Popova and Theo van Doesburg.

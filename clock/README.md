# Abstract Artist Clocks

These are abstract clocks made with p5.js. The easiest way to see them in action is to copy the contents of the javascript file  into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it.

Each clock is designed to look like a piece of abstract art (a reflection of the fact that our understanding of time is abstract and entirely arbitrary to begin with), though slightly different at different parts of the day. Each clock is designed to be recognizable as itself no matter the time of day, and is named after artists it mimicks. 

# Stella Delaunay
This clock is made of overlapping circles, one representing seconds, another representing minutes, and the last representing hours. It is designed to mimic the circular designs of both Robert and Sonia Delaunay, and the color choices of Frank Stella, whose style of art is also very similar to the Delaunays'. 

# Popova van Doesburg
[This clock](https://editor.p5js.org/brdust/full/pUMjqilLQ) is inspired by multiple artists, namely Lyubov Popova and Theo van Doesburg. This clock is one of the simplest, with the width of the dark blue triangle across the top of the display marking the progress through the hours of the day, and the green triangleâ€™s progress across the bottom marking the progress through the minutes of the current hour. The red circle that grows from the center is the most dynamic part of the clock, growing with each second until the minute is complete, at which point it disappears and starts from the center again. Each of these is partially transparent, creating a wider variety of colors as the minutes and hours interact with the seconds passing by.

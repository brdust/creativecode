# Weaving Psychedelic Ball

This project was a "screensaver" inspired by many of the old Windows screensavers from my childhood. This included the one with the stars flying at the screen, making it look like you were flying through space, and the colorful pipes that built endlessly. When I was a kid, my mom and dad had their computers on opposite sides of the office desk, so that they were facing each other when they sat there together. There were many times I'd be sitting there, talking to my mom about something or another, and just stare at whatever screesaver my dad had on that week with glazed-over eyes for half an hour at a time. 

My goal was to replicate something similar that I could stare at forever that would mesmerize me and make my mind wander. I'd say I definitely succeeded, as I found myself zoning out several times by accident when working on it.

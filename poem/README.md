# Poem of Fact

This script is designed to read a file full of facts about animals, and pull sets of noun phrases and random words to form a 9 line conceptual poem. Its structure is fairly simple, extracting nouns, noun phrases, verbs, and adjectives in varying line lengths and syntactic structures, and throwing them in randomly. 

Given this set of random assignments, the poem is intended to be nonsense, but has an interesting effect when viewed through the lense of experience, personality, and thought. Much like how people will find identifiable shapes, like when one goes cloud-watching, in entirely random patterns, the reader will make associatiions and string together different meaning from the words in an attempt to make sense of something with almost no parameters. 

I also hope it will encourage people to think about how langugae is structured, and how we make sense of things, and make much more complicated decisions about what to place where than this code does.

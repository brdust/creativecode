# Poem of Facts

This script is designed to read a file full of facts about animals, and pull sets of noun phrases and random words to form a 12 line poem. Given the structure, it is largely nonsense, but people can apply reason and interpretation to it. In this way the poem ends up being an interactive exercise in exploring the ways people make connections and look for patterns by nature, much how people will see 'faces' or other identifiable shapes in random patterns.

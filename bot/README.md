# Bot Project

This bot, [@BusinessPlanBot](https://twitter.com/BusinessPlanBot), is structured to create a four or five step 'plan' in the format of the once popular meme "Step 1: __, Step 2: ___, Step 3: ???, Step 4: Profit." There is also the inserted chance at failure to generate a full plan. 

This bot came about from a desire to play around with nesting capabilities and combining variables in a way that would potentially be funny. It hasn't quite turned out that way, and I may in the future edit the noun variables and structure to fit that purpose better, but it works as intended for the moment. 

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
